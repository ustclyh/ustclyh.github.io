## About Me

I am a research assistant professor at <a href="https://siqse.sustech.edu.cn" rel="noopener"><autocolor>Shenzhen International Quantum Academy</autocolor></a>. 
Now, I lead a lab focusing on integrated photonic quantum information, which is a part of the group of Integrated Photonics leading by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=s2uQynQAAAAJ" rel="noopener">Prof. Junqiu Liu</a>. 

I received my bachelor degree of physics at <a href="https://ustc.edu.cn" rel="noopener"><autocolor>University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)</autocolor></a> in 2016. In 2021, I received my Ph.D. degree from USTC under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0AJt_zEAAAAJ" rel="noopener">Prof. Chaoyang Lu</a>. During my doctoral period, I was mainly engaged in the research of experimental multiphoton entanglement.
In 2022, I joined Prof. Junqiu Liuâ€™s group as Presidential Postdoctoral fellow at <a href="https://www.sustech.edu.cn" rel="noopener"><autocolor>Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)</autocolor></a>.
